    <h3 class="text-center">Our history</h3>
      <p>In 2002 <span class="Red">ILS</span> was setup as a charitable organisation with the mission of offering support to vulnerable adults and young people who were homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. People who, for whatever reason, often did not fit the criteria for support and help through the conventional channels and the various statutory organizations.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although we have always been willing and ready to take any necessary direct action on behalf of vulnerable people, our primary aim has always been to empower people and support them along the path to greater personal independence.

    <h3 class="text-center">Housing Support</h3> 
      <p>In 2014 Dumfries and Galloway Council decided to change they funded outreach support in the region. As part of this change <span class="Red">ILS</span> along with the other organisations in the area and beyond were asked to bid for the new contracts for outreach housing support.
      <br>
      <br>
      In April 2015 we were awarded the contract to deliver support to people living in Dumfries Burgh, Nithsdale and Stranraer. In our first year we delivered over 4000 hours of support working from our offices in both Dumfries and Stranraer.
