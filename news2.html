<p><span class="Red">ILS</span> is a charity, based in Dumfries, we were formed 2002 by Joy Usher a retired Social Worker who recognised that vulnerable people were not being offered support because they didn’t fit the criteria for statutory organisations. We offer support to vulnerable individuals from 16 upwards who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Our aim is to encourage and support an individual’s journey toward increased independence.</p><p>Our Mission Statement reads “From Simply Surviving to Actively Thriving”</p><p>Having gone through the tendering process in 2015 <span class="Red">ILS</span> won the contract to deliver outreach housing support to people living in Dumfries Burgh, Nithsdale and Stranraer.
 
<p>We are contracted to deliver weekly support to our clients, we currently support people from our Dumfries office and our office in Stranraer. Since the contract started we have delivered over 4000 hours of support to vulnerable people in our contracted areas.</p>
 
<p>The programs we have developed have been in response to the needs service users expressed to us. <span class="Red">ILS</span> has developed expertise in working effectively with young and vulnerable people. Our culture is a supportive one. The relationship we build is genuine and lasting. Individuals return to us for help because they know we will listen, be non- judgemental and support their efforts in a way that works for them.</p>
 
<p>The remit provided by two of our funders has enabled us to find the resource to deliver this work. However, if we are to continue to help people into work we need funding specifically for this project.</p>
 
<p><span class="Red">ILS</span> has joined a number of local employability forums. These provide an insight into local needs and issues. Being a small organisation we can quickly adapt to changing needs. We will continue to develop our links to employers.</p>
 
<p>Since the start of the new contract <span class="Red">ILS</span> can only take referrals for Housing Support from the homeless department however we are able to take referrals from any source for our Personal Development Project which is funded by the Holywood Trust. Much of our work involves supporting young and vulnerable people to re-engage with their communities and to progress towards independence</p>
 
<p>We are able to refer our Service Users to agencies like Job Centre Plus Addaction, ADS. <span class="Red">ILS</span> supports all people in need regardless of issue. Where specialist intervention (e.g. health related) is required we support the interaction with the relevant agency. Many individuals are reluctant to engage with official provision.</p>

<p>We form a relationship with the service user and because of the culture we have developed people are willing to work with us and be supported. Housing Support enables us to deal with housing issues.</p>
 
<p>We believe that given a secure and supported context individuals can find the room to grow toward independence. Work, of course, is often the final step toward complete independence. We do not try to find work for service users but rather support fully their own job search efforts.</p>
 
<p>Specialist third sector and public service providers are utilised wherever necessary. We do not try to duplicate existing provision. <span class="Red">ILS</span> current funding allows us to help individuals secure and retain accommodation. However, what we can achieve is engagement with the provision that is there.</p>
 
<p><span class="Red">ILS</span> utilises the Outcomes Star Matrix which is an Assessment Tool for monitoring the progress of supported service users and records outcome summaries on a central database.</p>
 
<p>Because of the generosity of the Holywood Trusts we are able, where appropriate, to support a programme of personal development. The outcome is an individual who can live and function successfully within their community. If successful, this funding would enable us to support individuals as they move from a variety of circumstances toward the world of training and work.</p>
 
<p>We are able to give people the time and support they need to develop at a personal level. It is above all a personal service.</p>
